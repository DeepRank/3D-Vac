#### 2.1: Building DB2 from DB1
DB2 contains 3D models (output of Pandora, pdb structures) for: pMHC-I in DB1-I (DB2-I), and pMHC-II in DB1-II (DB2-II). DB1-I and DB1-II are used as input for Pandora. 
`build_db2_I.sh` is ther only script that needs to be run. It takes care of checking which models are missing, distributing computations accross the nodes and cleaning the incomplete outputs at the end.

`modelling_job.py` is implicitly called and it's the actual script taking care of the modelling. To change specific modelling options, like anchors restraints standard deviation, number of models, C domain etc., modify this script.

Output folder structure (after cleaning with clean_outputs.sh):

```
│── <target_id>_<template_id>
│   │
│   ├── <template_id>.pdb           Template pdb file used for the modelling
│   │
│   ├── molpdf_DOPE.tsv             Ranking all models by molpdf and DOPE modeller's scoring functions
│   │
│   ├── <target_id>.BL00??0001.pdb  Final models
│   │
│   ├── modeller.log                Printing log file generated by MODELLER, describing modelling steps, or any issues arose along modelling
│   │
│   ├── *.ali                       Alignment file between template(s) and target used for modelling
│   │
│   ├── contacts_*.list             Contact restraints
│   │
│   ├── MyLoop.py                   MODELLER script to set loop modelling parameters for the peptide
│   │
│   ├── cmd_modeller_ini.py         MODELLER script to generate an initial model to extract restraints from
│   │
│   ├── cmd_modeller.py             MODELLER script to set the main modelling parameters
│   │
│   ├── *.ini                       Initial model generated placing the target atoms at the same coordinate as the template's atoms. This preceeds the IL model.
│   │
│   ├── *IL*.pdb                    Initial loop model based on the .ini model. Might be marked as best model when the target is identicatl to a template
